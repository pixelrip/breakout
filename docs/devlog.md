# Dev Log
Total Time: 00

## TODO:

## Possible optimizations:
- [Shrinko8](https://github.com/thisismypassport/shrinko8)
- rectangle.lua could draw simpler rectangles if there is no angle (token / performance tradeoff)
- Lot of duplication with the tuning constants and entity creation

## Daily Notes

### Day 1: 2025-10-24

- Time worked: 9a -> 
- Proof of concept for rotating paddle
- Futzing with hybrid component-based architecture, probably overkill and I run the risk of token limitats--but good for learning
- Created Mover and InputMover component, integrated with paddle
- Created Ball entity and added some pinball style physics
- Created Arena entity which is basically just visual right now (but adjustable)
-
